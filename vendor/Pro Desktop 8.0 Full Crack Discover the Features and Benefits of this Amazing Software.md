- The edit tool, which lets you modify your sketches and features by moving, scaling, rotating, copying, deleting or changing their properties.

To use these tools, you need to select them from the toolbars or the menu bar and follow the instructions on the status bar. You can also use the mouse buttons and the keyboard shortcuts to perform various actions. For example:

- To select an object, click it with the left mouse button.
