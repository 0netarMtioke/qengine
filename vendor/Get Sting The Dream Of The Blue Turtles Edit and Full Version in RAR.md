Sting's The Dream of the Blue Turtles is considered to be his first solo album after leaving The Police. It was a commercial and critical success, reaching the top ten in several countries and earning three Grammy nominations. The album showcases Sting's diverse musical influences, ranging from jazz and reggae to classical and rock. It also features prominent musicians such as Branford Marsalis, Kenny Kirkland, Omar Hakim, and Darryl Jones.
 
The album's title refers to a dream that Sting had, in which he saw a turtle in his garden. He followed it to a lake, where he saw four other turtles, each with a different color: blue, red, yellow, and black. He interpreted this as a symbol of his new band, which consisted of four musicians from different backgrounds and cultures. He also saw the turtles as a metaphor for his artistic freedom and exploration.
 
The album's cover art depicts Sting standing in front of a painting by the British artist Stephen Hannock. The painting shows a nocturnal scene of an English village, with a large moon and a blue turtle in the sky. The painting was inspired by Sting's song "Moon Over Bourbon Street", which is based on the novel Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice. The painting also contains hidden messages and references to Sting's personal life and career.
